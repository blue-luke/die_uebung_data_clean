# die_uebung_data_clean

A simple programme that takes a .txt document found online (converted from pdf), extracts only the nouns, then re-writes to another text document so it can be fed into the die_uebung project. Once fed in, it will automatically populate a list of nouns that the user will be tested on, as a part of a language learning programme.
